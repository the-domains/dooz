dooZ was founded in 2012 by me to help shape the mobile landscape. Now in 2016 we are ready for a new chapter. At dooZ I always had a strong believe in the technology and design dance. 

So I am proud to announce that we are working hard to make that happen. And yes it is we now. dooZ will work together with  [Chiara Vercesi][0] to bring you a immersive mobile experience.

Come back here for more later this month!
